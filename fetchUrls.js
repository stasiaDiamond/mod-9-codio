/*
Instructions:

In this activity, there are two steps

First, you will fetch all the weather data from the OpenWeather API
Second, you will identify the specific weather data to show based on a given city name

1. Asynchronously fetch data from different URLs and store the data in the `dataArray`.
2. Filter the data based on the city name.
3. Display the data for the city of Lisbon by manipulating the DOM

Hints:
Use the await keyword for both sending the request out to URL and fetching the data response as shown in the fetch example above.

Be sure to parse the received data as text, just like the example, in order to proceed with the second step of this exercise.

------Challenges:

1. doing enough research to deeply understand what a wrapper function and async/await do

2. doing enough research to deeply understand what a a dang Promise is. it's much more complicated when not just dealing with returning an HTTP request. def went down quite the rabbit hole

3. finding out that my beloved asterisk is already part of a  markup language. temporarily, i'll use a ~ symbol from now on until i take the time to learn how to JSDoc correctly

4. notice, none of this was taught nor mentioned: just thrown out there. i truly don't understand how MItxPro Emeritus guarantees or even know what nor ho much of this students actually learn. since they give us the Solution Files, so much important info could be 100% skipped over and never understood

5. i think all this work i'm doing to figure out and explain in extreme detail what all this code is doing might be called reverse engineering... which is great! quite the skill!


6. Promise Face Melters: 

~ in a function declaration: async means the function itself is asynchronous and will always return a Promise

~ in a function call: async means that the function being called is expected to return a Promise (it does not automatically make the function it's contained in asynchronous by itself) it just allows the use of await for that specific function call

~ a Promise is an Object that has 2 Methods: .then() and .catch()
~ a Promise basically replaces a callback function for asynchronous operations in ES6
~ a Promise is either resolved or rejected
~ a Promise Object is always expected when we use async

~ the Promise Object represents an eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
~ it also will carry with it: the resulting value of said completion or failure
~ when created, a Promise is in a "pending" state, once completed successfully it's in "fulfilled" state, and if it encounters an error it's in "rejected" state


Callback vs Promise Example:

Callback Style:
---------------
function readFileAsynchronously(fileName) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const fileContents = `Contents of ${fileName}`;
      resolve(fileContents);
        reject(new Error(`Error reading ${fileName}`));
    }, 1000);
  });
}

Promise Style:
--------------
const fileName = "example.txt";

readFileAsynchronously(fileName)
  .then((contents) => {
    console.log(`File contents: ${contents}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  });
